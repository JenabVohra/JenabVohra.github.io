                    <h3>EWHEELZ</h3>
                    <h5>Technologies used :Selenium ,MySQL ,JMeter ,Manual Testing ,Agile methodlogy ,WebStress,Glowroot ,MSExcel , PowerPoint , Ms Word ,Non-functional testing: UAT testing , cross -browser testing , load testing </h5>
                    <p class="mb-0">This was the project which we as team worked for whole semester during course. It was a real testing project to be continued from basic test plan to developing test cases, from submitting agenda to keeping the logbook. We used Scrum methodology for the overall project. It also followed SDLC process for updation in the application. We worked on unit testing by visiting the website and marking down its flaws manually and then develop test plan and gather requirements for developing test cases .In addition to it, we had performed manual testing and measured its efficiency and errors and then moving further with the automation testing using Selenium we obtained more details about the internal defects. There was a load test perform using the glowroot and performance test by web stress tool. MySQL played a vital role in this project keeping the data we used for testing manually. The overall project was run on agile processes and the sprints are generated every week can help to remain website working and the updation can take place if the flaw was corrected.</p><br>

                    <p class="mb-0">It is a TDD project built with Junit where the test cases were checked according to the rules and the condition applied. The base program was prepared in java for the design and then test cases were written which indicated pass and fail  and where checked. The basic structure for the grid of 20*20 cells was prepared first and then implemented the code to check. The Gerkhins were made accordingly as rules and condition. The program can be implemented in javascript too. But the project was based on TDD and ATDD environment.</p>
